Q.1)What platforms are available for developing mobile apps?

Following are the platforms that are used for developing mobile applications:

1.)Swiftic
2.)Native Scripts
3.)React Native
4.)Xamarin
5.)Ionic
6.)Sencha Ext JS
7.)Onsen UI
8.)Flutter
9.)Corona
10.)JQuery Mobile

Q.2)Native(Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-c) vs Cross Platforms(React-native, Flutter, Cordova, ionic)

Ans.)Following are the differences between Native(Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-c) and Cross Platforms(React-native, Flutter, Cordova, ionic)

Native apps -> Native applications runs on their native operating system.For example android applications those are built on java cannot run on ios operating system and android application while are built on swift,objective c cannot run on android operating systems.

Native applications have higher performance as compared to cross platform applications.

They are expensive as compared to cross platform applications

They are more time consuming as compared to cross platform applications

cross platform applications -> These appliactions share the same codebase to run on multiple platforms thus same codebase can create both android applications as well as ios apllications. For example react native,flutter xamarin these are the framework through which we can create android applications and ios application with the same codebase.

cross platform applications leg in performance as compared to native applications

They take less time to get build as compared to native applications

They are cheaper in cost as compared to native applications.

Q.3)Core differences among - React-native, Flutter, Cordova, ionic etc

Ans.)Following are the core differences between react-native, Flutter, Cordova and ionic

Basis of comparison:

1.)Coded in

React natice -> JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, Java,
Objective-C, Swift

Flutter ->Dart

Ionic -> JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS

cordova -> HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

2.)Cross-platform applicability

React-native -> Most of the codebase is reusable
but requires adaptation to a particular platform

Flutter -> Most of the codebase is reusable across platforms and the web

Ionic -> Most of the codebase is reusable for different platforms

cordova -> cross-platform development.

3.)User experience

React-native -> Responsive

Flutter -> Native

Ionic -> Suboptimal

Cordova -> Suboptimal

Q.4)Why react native and why not? (Pros and Cons)

Ans.)Following are the reasons why we should use react native.

1.)One codebase for two platforms

2.)Savings in time and money

3.)great development speed

4.)A mild learning curve for JS developers

5.)Access to a wide talent pool and easy switch from web to mobile

Following are the reasons why we should not use react native.

1.)Performance issues

2.)Upgrading complexities

3.)The lack of out-of-the-box support for native components

Q.5)Execution process of react native code.

Ans.)React Native allows developers to build apps by spinning up JS threads that interpret JavaScript code, by making a native bridge between the app and the target platform. The bridge concept leverages the library and transfers the component’s hierarchy to the mobile devices view.

For instance, if the user presses a button, this case is translated into an event that JavaScript can handle. After that, by relaying messages between native platforms and JS code, the React Native bridges translates native events into something that React components can understand and work with.

Q.6)Why react native and why not? (Pros and Cons)

Ans.)Following are the pros of react native:

Easy to work with –> experienced developers will definitely appreciate the development experience. Meaningful error messages, time-saving and robust tools make it a premium choice over other platforms.

Works everywhere –> Once you learn React Native, you can build apps for iOS and Android and Windows.

Intelligent debugging tools –> and error reporting mechanisms. Give it an advantage over others and allows developers to focus more on the productive part.

Following are the cons of using react native:

Performance is still lower than native –> React Native is not able to use all the blessings and potential of a specific platform. On the other hand, a native app can really maximize functionalities and deliver the ultimate user experience in the result.

Not efficient design-wise –> If you consider complicated designs or advanced interactions as a crucial part of your business advantage, you should definitely go for native development.

Custom modules –> many custom modules are already available, yet, there may be a need for some specific components that you will be forced to build from scratch yourself.
